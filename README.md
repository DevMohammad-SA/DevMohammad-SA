I'm not just a developer; I'm someone who's deeply passionate about technology in all its forms. Currently pursuing my Computer Science degree, I'm constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies and approaches to solving problems through code.

Python is my language of choice, but I believe in using the right tool for the job, which has led me to become proficient in various languages and frameworks.

As a Linux enthusiast, I value customization, efficiency, and deep understanding of the systems I work with. This philosophy extends to my development approach ‚Äì I don't just make things work; I strive to understand why and how they work.
